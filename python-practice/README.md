# Python Practice Exercises

This folder contains exercises organized by week. Start with week1-basics and work your way through.

## Prerequisites

This course requires Python 3. If Python is not installed in your environment, install it with:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python3
```

Verify installation: `python3 --version`

## How to Use

1. Open a file (e.g., `week1-basics/01_variables.py`)
2. Read the comments (lines starting with #)
3. Run the file: `python3 week1-basics/01_variables.py`
4. Modify the code and run it again
5. Complete the TODO items in each file

## Folder Structure

Each week contains 3 files following a consistent pattern:
1. `01_*.py` - Core concept introduction with examples
2. `02_*.py` - Additional practice
3. `03_*.py` - Mini project applying the concepts

### Weekly Topics

- **week1-basics** - Variables, data types, basic operations
- **week2-basics** - String operations, number conversions
- **week3-control-flow** - If statements, comparisons, decision making
- **week4-control-flow** - For loops, while loops, repetition
- **week5-data-structures** - Lists, list operations, collections
- **week6-data-structures** - Dictionaries, key-value pairs
- **week7-functions** - Function basics, parameters, return values
- **week8-functions** - Advanced functions, *args, **kwargs, lambdas
- **week9-files** - Reading and writing text files
- **week10-files** - CSV and JSON file operations

## Key Features

- **No external dependencies** - Uses only Python standard library
- **Self-contained exercises** - Each file runs independently
- **Progressive difficulty** - Each week builds on previous concepts
- **Hands-on learning** - Working examples followed by TODO exercises
- **Mini projects** - Apply concepts in practical applications

## Tips

- Don't rush - understanding is more important than speed
- Run the code after every change to see what happens
- Read error messages - they tell you what went wrong
- Experiment and break things - that's how you learn!
- Track your progress in `PROGRESS.md`
