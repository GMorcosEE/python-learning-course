# Python Practice Exercises

This folder contains exercises organized by week. Start with week1-basics and work your way through.

## How to Use

1. Open a file (e.g., `week1-basics/01_variables.py`)
2. Read the comments (lines starting with #)
3. Run the file: `python3 week1-basics/01_variables.py`
4. Modify the code and run it again
5. Complete the TODO items in each file
