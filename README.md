# Python Learning Course

A structured, beginner-friendly Python course with 10 weeks of hands-on exercises. Learn Python fundamentals through practical examples and mini projects.

## Overview

This course teaches Python from the ground up using a learn-by-doing approach. Each week introduces new concepts with working code examples, followed by exercises to reinforce learning.

**Course Duration:** 10 weeks  
**Prerequisites:** None - designed for complete beginners  
**Approach:** Self-paced, hands-on learning

## What You'll Learn

| Weeks | Topics | Skills |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1-2 | **Basics** | Variables, data types, strings, numbers, user input |
| 3-4 | **Control Flow** | If/else statements, comparisons, for/while loops |
| 5-6 | **Data Structures** | Lists, dictionaries, operations on collections |
| 7-8 | **Functions** | Creating functions, parameters, returns, advanced concepts |
| 9-10 | **File I/O** | Reading/writing files, working with CSV and JSON |

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup Python

This course requires Python 3. Check if it's installed:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If not installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python3
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GMorcosEE/python-learning-course.git
cd python-learning-course
```

### 3. Start Learning

Navigate to the exercises folder and begin with week 1:

```bash
cd python-practice
python3 week1-basics/01_variables.py
```

```

### Weekly Pattern

Each week follows a consistent structure:
- **File 1** (`01_*.py`) - Core concept with examples
- **File 2** (`02_*.py`) - Additional practice
- **File 3** (`03_*.py`) - Mini project

## Learning Workflow

1. **Read** the comments in each `.py` file
2. **Run** the file to see the examples in action
3. **Experiment** by modifying values and code
4. **Complete** the TODO exercises at the end
5. **Track** your progress in `PROGRESS.md`
6. **Move** to the next file when ready

## Projects You'll Build

By completing this course, you'll create:

- ✅ Number guessing game
- ✅ Shopping list manager
- ✅ Phonebook application
- ✅ Calculator with functions
- ✅ Text analyzer
- ✅ Note-taking app
- ✅ Contact manager with JSON storage

## Key Features
